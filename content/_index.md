Hi! I'm Mica and I mostly use this domain for email but I figured I'd put
something here.

I _used to_ try and actually write regular blog articles on whatever I was doing
buuuut I'm pretty bad at writing about what I do if I'm not forced to do it.
(Neurodivergence might have something to do with it.) I'm trying to get better
at it (again).

Here are some recent posts:

Here are some old articles for posterity and cringe (and because I hate leaving
broken links on the internet):

- [NixOS: Avoiding filesystem corruption with hibernation and ephemeral root](https://tbx.at/posts/ephemeral-rootfs-corruption)
- [Restoring my broken file system with Btrfs, NixOS and Restic](https://tbx.at/posts/filesystem-restore)

You can email me at [hatsune@mica.lgbt](mailto:hatsune@mica.lgbt). Thanks for
respecting my [pronouns](/pronouns) when you do! Oh, and I was also
peer-pressured into signing up for Matrix: @hmica:matrix.org. And the Fediverse:
