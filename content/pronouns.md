title: Pronouns
---

This page lists pronouns I'm cool with in the languages I speak. As a general
rule of thumb for languages not listed here:

- If there's widely used gender neutral pronouns, use those.
- Otherwise female pronous are cool too.
- If your language doesn't have gendered pronouns, you've won in life.
- Neopronouns might also be cool but I wanna understand them in the context of a
  language before approving of them being used for myself.

## English

Preferred: singular "they/them", so they/them/their/theirs/themself. The plural
reflexive "themselves" is also okay.

I'm also cool with "she/her" though. ðŸ˜Š

## German

I haaaate this language. I hate it so muuuuch.

(I'm allowed to say this, I'm a native speaker.)

Not only is there no good way to address enby and otherwise gender
non-conforming folks in German, efforts to make the language more gender-neutral
also make conservatives _lose their minds_ for some reason.

It would be great if gender just wasn't as pervasive as it is in this language.

The German language has no widely-used gender neutral pronouns, so I pretty much
just use "sie/ihr".

There are movements to establish gender neutral pronouns in this language, the
(seemingly?) most widely covered one being the
["sier"](https://www.annaheger.de/pronomen21/) and
["xier"](https://www.annaheger.de/pronomen33/) pronouns by Illi Anna Heger. Out
of those, I'm cool with "xier".

I also randomly found "xie/ihr" to be a nice pronoun in German. It's basically
"sie" but starting with an "x". It's more or less something I came up with
myself but I feel like it's such a simple idea that I can't be the only one
who's thought of it.

Because I like being exact and also making fun of how complicated German grammar
is, here are some tables relating all of the pronouns I accept in German in
their various grammatical cases.

### Personal pronouns

| "Family" | Nominative | Genitive | Dative | Accusative |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **xie**  | xie        | xihrer   | xihr   | xie        |
| **xier** | xier       | xieser   | xiem   | xien       |
| **sie**  | sie        | ihrer    | ihr    | sie        |

### Relative pronouns

| "Family" | Nominative | Genitive    | Dative | Accusative |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **xie**  | die        | deren/derer | der    | die        |
| **xier** | dier       | dies        | diem   | dien       |
| **sie**  | die        | deren/derer | der    | die        |

### Possesive pronouns

Possesive pronouns relate two nouns. They can occur together with a noun or as a
stand-in for a noun which are two distict variants. Possesive pronouns also vary
based on the grammatical gender of the noun they refer to and the grammatical
gender of the noun they relate to (and of course the grammatical case). This
would be a four-dimensional cube, so I've ommitted spelling those out here. In
general:

- **xie** (how I've defined it at least) uses the same ending as **sie** but the
  base (Stamm) is "xihr".
  - Sie hat ihre Tasche vergessen. (Reference example only using "sie"
    pronouns.)
  - Xie hat xihre Tasche vergessen.
  - Xie hat xihrer Freundin geholfen. ("Freundin" is referred to with "sie"
    pronouns.)
  - Sie hat das ihrer Freundin zu verdanken. ("Freundin" is referred to with
    "xie" pronouns.)
- **xier** uses "xies" as the base form and suggests "-a" as the ending.
  - Xier hat xieser Freundin geholfen. ("Freundin" is referred to with "sie"
    pronouns.)
  - Sie hat das ihra Freundin zu verdanken. ("Freundin" is referred to wie
    "xier" pronouns.)
